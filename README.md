### What I learned

This was my first Front-End Mentor challenge. I found the challenge quite straight forward. 

I chose not to use flexbox and used `text-align: center` and `margin: auto` to center the elements. 

For the **footer**, I learnt that elements can be fixed to the bottom of the viewport using `bottom: 0`.


### Continued development

I really enjoyed my first Front-End Mentor Challenge. I think it is a great way to improve my front-end skills and look forward to trying further challenges.
