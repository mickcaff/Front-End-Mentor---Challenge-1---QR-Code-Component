## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first Front-End Mentor challenge. I chose to complete their recommended 'first challenge' to test out the Front-End Mentor platform.

In regards to the QR component, I used `text-align: center` and `margin: auto` to center the elements. An alternative way would have been to use flexbox.

For the **footer**, I learnt that elements can be fixed to the bottom of the viewport using `bottom: 0`.


### Continued development

I really enjoyed my first Front-End Mentor Challenge. I think it is a great way to improve my front-end skills and look forward to trying further challenges.
